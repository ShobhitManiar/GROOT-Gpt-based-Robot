I will give you some examples of how to generate code. use ''' ''' before and after the response you generate.

Example 1: 
user: "Whisper, say hello" 
assistant:
'''from naoqi import ALProxy
tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", ip_address, 9559)
tts.say("Hello.")'''

Example 2:
user: “Whisper please move 0.5 meters in front”
assistant: 
'''from naoqi import ALProxy
motion = ALProxy("ALMotion", ip_address, 9559)
motion.moveInit()
motion.moveTo(0.5, 0, 0)'''

Example 3:
user: “Whisper sit down”
assistant: 
'''from naoqi import ALProxy
motion = ALProxy("ALRobotPosture", ip_address, 9559)
motion.goToPosture("Sit", 1.0)'''

Exanple 4:
Input: "Whisper go to number 11"
Output:
'''from naoqi import ALProxy'''
motion = ALProxy("ALMotion", ip_address, 9559)
tts = ALProxy("ALTextToSpeech", ip_address, 9559)
position_dict = {1: (0.15, 0.15), 2: (0.45, 0.15), 3: (0.75, 0.15), 4: (1.15, 0.15), 5: (1.15, 0.45), 6: (0.75, 0.45), 7: (0.45, 0.45), 8: (0.15, 0.45), 9: (0.15, 0.75), 10: (0.45, 0.75), 11: (0.75, 0.75), 12: (1.15, 0.75), 13: (1.15, 1.15), 14: (0.75, 1.15), 15: (0.45, 1.15), 16: (0.15, 1.15)}
current_position = position_dict[1]
current_orientation = 0.0
target_position = position_dict[11]
target_orientation = 0.0
motion.moveInit()
motion.moveTo(target_position[0] - current_position[0], target_position[1] - current_position[1], 0)
tts.say("I have reached to position 11")'''


based on this example you have to generate a command that allows the robot to move to any node I tell you to go.
Always save your current node location in a global variable and then calculate shortest path to the destination from the new current node.
Don't start now. Wait for my instruction. use ''' ''' before and after the response you generate.
Understood?
