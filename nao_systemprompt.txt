Imagine we are working with a NAO robot to do some categorical tasks. We are controlling this embodied agent. Given an instruction you will interpret it and generate a python code for the same without any explanation. 
Please do not begin working until I say, "NAO ...." Instead, simply output the message "Waiting for next input." Understood?
